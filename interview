Got it 👍 — you don’t want ready-made answers, just tough interview questions (not Q&A style).
Here’s a production-focused question list you can directly ask Vikash in the interview, aligned with his resume.

🔹 Linux & Shell Scripting

How would you find which process is using the most memory on a Linux server?

A cronjob you created didn’t run at 2 AM. Walk me through your debugging steps.

Write a shell script to monitor disk usage and send an alert if it goes above 80%.

What’s the difference between hard link and soft link, and when would you use each?

🔹 AWS (Cloud)

You deployed an application on EC2 with an ELB. Suddenly, one instance crashed. What happens next?

How do you restrict an S3 bucket so only an EC2 in a private subnet can access it?

Explain how you’d design a 3-tier (web, app, DB) architecture on AWS for high availability.

How do you troubleshoot “Access Denied” errors when uploading to an S3 bucket?

🔹 Docker & Containers

A containerized app keeps restarting in production. How do you debug it?

Explain the difference between CMD and ENTRYPOINT in a Dockerfile with examples.

How do you reduce the size of a large Docker image?

How would you securely pass database credentials into a container in production?

🔹 Jenkins / CI-CD

You set up a Jenkins pipeline with GitHub webhook. How do you prevent duplicate builds on the same commit?

What’s your recovery plan if the Jenkins master server crashes?

How do you move an artifact from dev → test → prod in a pipeline?

Declarative vs Scripted pipelines in Jenkins — which one would you use in production and why?

🔹 Monitoring & Logging

How would you monitor latency, errors, and traffic for an application (RED method)?

Your Grafana dashboard shows zero traffic, but the app is serving requests. How do you debug?

Logs in Loki show a spike in errors, but the app team says everything is fine. How do you confirm?

Compare push-based monitoring (CloudWatch) with pull-based monitoring (Prometheus). Which is better for microservices?

🔹 Networking & Security

A user in the US says your website isn’t resolving, but it works in India. How do you troubleshoot?

Explain the difference between Security Groups and NACLs in AWS with real use cases.

What steps would you take if the SSL certificate for your production app is expiring tonight?

How would you protect a VPC-based application from DDoS attacks?

🔹 Terraform / Kubernetes (he’s learning)

What happens if two people run terraform apply at the same time? How do you avoid conflicts?

If your Terraform state file is deleted, how do you recover your infrastructure?

In Kubernetes, how do you expose a pod to the outside world? Explain NodePort, ClusterIP, and LoadBalancer.

A pod is stuck in CrashLoopBackOff. How do you troubleshoot it?

🔹 Real-World Production Scenarios

Your app deployment succeeded, but 2 hours later CPU usage shot up to 90%. What steps do you take?

How would you implement zero-downtime deployments in AWS?

Your monitoring system is generating too many false alerts at night. How do you fix it without missing real issues?

How would you design a secure CI/CD pipeline that includes GitHub, Jenkins, Docker, and AWS?
